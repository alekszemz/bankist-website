<p>This is a fictional marketing website for the <strong>"Bankist"</strong> bank. The website includes many effects written in <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>. For example, <strong>fade-in sections, lazy loading images, sticky navbar, slider, tabs</strong>, etc. </p>

The course covered everything from the basics of JavaScript to advanced topics such as asynchronous programming and object-oriented programming. </p>
<p>The developer was able to apply the knowledge gained from the course to create a dynamic and interactive website for the Bankist bank. The website is designed to showcase the bank's products and services in an engaging and user-friendly way. </p>
